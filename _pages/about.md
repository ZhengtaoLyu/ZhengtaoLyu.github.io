<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a recent graduate with a Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Exeter, combining a rigorous mathematical foundation with advanced programming skills to drive impactful AI and data-driven solutions.

My expertise lies in deep mathematical modeling and algorithm development, with hands-on experience in cutting-edge machine learning techniques such as:

YOLO for real-time computer vision tasks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and LSTM for sequential and spatial data modeling

Isolation Forest for robust anomaly detection

Classical and modern algorithms including SVM, GANs, Markov Chains, and K-Means

Python is my primary development language. I am highly proficient in data manipulation and analysis using Pandas and NumPy, and adept at managing structured datasets with MySQL (Community Edition) to support scalable data workflows.

My passion lies in translating complex mathematical theories into efficient, production-ready code. I thrive on tackling challenging problems that require both analytical rigor and innovative engineering, delivering solutions that are not only technically sound but also business-relevant.

I welcome opportunities to collaborate on projects that leverage AI and mathematics to unlock real-world value. Feel free to explore my repositories for examples of my work and reach out to connect!
